<center> A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for gymnastics, athletics, and gymnastic services. 
 The word is derived from the ancient Greek gymnasium.[1] They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness center", which is often an area for indoor recreation.

 Gymnasia apparatus such as barbells, parallel bars, jumping board, running path, tennis-balls, cricket field, fencing area, and so forth are used as exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health.[2] Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included Gymnastica militaria or self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, 
 and gymnastica athletica for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing.
 These gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them. Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing.
 There were schools of dagger fighting and wrestling and boxing.</center><br><br>

<center><b><h4>1. “Strength does not come from the physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.” – Ghandi</h4></b></center><br><br>
<center>This feeling is especially common if you haven’t worked out in forever (or maybe it’s even your first time) and you’re feeling like everyone around you is in much better shape. They’re running through HIIT workouts with ease and you’re in the back struggling to get in a breath.</center><br><br>
<center>You feel like a fraud. And you can’t help but think: Who are you to try to train like any of these athletes?</center><br><br>
<center>Okay, let’s hit the brakes on this train of thought. First of all, every one of those people started somewhere. They didn’t leave the womb shredded with the endurance of a horse, and they surely don’t come to the gym just to stand around and show off how buff they are.</center><br><br>
<center>So what is the difference between you and them?</center><br><br>
<center>hey stopped thinking about others and got to work on improving themselves, regardless of their level of fitness. Their will to be better overrode their fear of being physically inadequate.</center><br><br>
<center>So struggle to catch your breath with pride. Soon enough, you’ll be better than the next beginner that steps through the doors.</center><br><br>

<center><b><h4>2.“Training gives us an outlet for suppressed energies created by stress and thus tones the spirit just as exercise conditions the body.” – Arnold Schwarzenegger</h4></b></center><br><br>
<center>Sometimes you can feel so stressed because of all of the things on your to-do list that you can barely roll out of bed to do them. The overwhelm is just too much, right?</center></br></br>
<center>Well, I’m here to tell you that you should definitely roll out of bed and get to that workout. It might not seem like it now, but once you get started, you’ll notice that you’re more energized, your mind is clearer, and you’re feeling sunnier thanks to the burst of endorphins.</center><br><br>
<center>Not to mention, having an outlet for all that built-up stress will help lower cortisol levels and reduce belly fat – a win-win.</center></br></br>

<center><b><h4>3. “Your body can stand almost anything. It’s your mind that you have to convince.”</h4></b></center><br><br>
<center>Developing a habit can be hard. While the logical side of your mind knows you should stick to a workout regimen to see results, the emotional side convinces you that skipping one more day won’t hurt anything.<center><br><br>
